I discarded my old Jekyll blog and built this one with [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) using [gatsby-starter-lumen](https://github.com/alxshelepenok/gatsby-starter-lumen). It looks like a real bloger's blog.

I also do blog in my [cnblog](https://www.cnblogs.com/holaworld/). This one is mainly for recording how to solve small problems I encountered.
